NOTE: this repo is old PLEASE DO NOT USE!. Slack currently has its own dark mode, so this one is not needed anymore!
Change slack background to dark

In order to have dark background in Slack, change the index.js file found in Applications/Slack.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/src/static/index.js to the one in this repo. After that, restart Slack and you'll have a dark background. Tested with Slack v. 2.6.3.
